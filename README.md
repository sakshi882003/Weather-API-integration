🌤 How to Integrate an External API in Spring Boot? 🚀
APIs are essential in modern applications for fetching real-time data like weather updates, stock prices, or news. Recently, I worked on integrating the Tomorrow.io Weather API into my Spring Boot project and faced some challenges. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you do the same!

✅ Why is API Integration Important?
🔹 Fetch real-time data dynamically.
🔹 Enhance application functionality with third-party services.
🔹 Automate data exchange between platforms.
🔹 Build scalable and flexible applications.

🚀 Steps to Integrate an External API in Spring Boot
1️⃣ Set Up Your Spring Boot Project
Ensure you have a Spring Boot project ready with the necessary dependencies for making HTTP requests and handling JSON data.
2️⃣ Use RestTemplate to Call the API
Spring Boot provides RestTemplate, which allows you to send GET requests and fetch data from an external API.
3️⃣ Create a Weather Response Model
Since the API returns data in JSON format, you need to create a model class in Java that matches the structure of the API response.
4️⃣ Expose an API Endpoint via Controller
Create a controller in Spring Boot that will fetch and return the weather data when a request is made to your endpoint.

🔥 Common Issues & Fixes
✅ Unrecognized field error
👉 Ignore unknown JSON fields to prevent deserialization issues.
✅ Response is not structured properly
👉 Ensure your Java model class matches the JSON structure exactly.
✅ API key issues
👉 Double-check your API key and make sure it's valid.

🎯 Key Takeaways
✔️ Spring Boot makes API integration simple and efficient.
✔️ Proper JSON mapping is crucial for handling API responses.
✔️ Always handle errors gracefully when working with external APIs.
Integrating external APIs adds powerful features to applications. Whether it's weather data, news feeds, or AI-based services, learning API integration in Spring Boot is a must-have skill for backend developers!
